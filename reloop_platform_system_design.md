# ReLoop Platform System Design

## Implementation Approach

Based on the PRD, we need to design a comprehensive circular economy platform that connects waste providers, process operators, and product buyers through an interconnected network of value chains. The platform must include value chain pages (Feedstock, ChemHub, LoopCrafted Product), marketplace functionality, community features including decentralized governance, and a 3D globe visualization.

### Key Technical Challenges

1. **Complex Data Relationships**: The platform needs to manage intricate relationships between different types of users, value chains, marketplace listings, and community nodes.

2. **Real-time Visualization**: The 3D globe visualization requires efficient real-time data processing and rendering.

3. **Decentralized Governance**: Implementing token-based voting and proposal systems while ensuring security and transparency.

4. **Scalability**: Supporting 10,000+ concurrent users, 1,000+ marketplace transactions per hour, and data for 100,000+ value chain nodes.

5. **Subscription Management**: Implementing a tiered subscription model for businesses that's affordable for startups.

### Selected Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React) for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components for the glassmorphism design
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js for the interactive globe and visualization
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for client state

#### Backend
- **API Framework**: Node.js with Express for RESTful API and Apollo Server for GraphQL
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT for session management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for real-time updates
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 (or compatible alternative) for storing images and documents
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization

#### DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent environments
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for scaling and management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring

#### Third-Party Services
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe for subscription management
- **Maps & Geolocation**: Mapbox for location-based services
- **Email Communication**: SendGrid for transactional emails

### Architecture Overview

We'll implement a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Each core function of the platform will be implemented as a separate service with well-defined APIs.

The architecture will consist of the following main components:

1. **User Service**: Handles user authentication, profiles, and roles
2. **Value Chain Service**: Manages Feedstock, ChemHub, and LoopCrafted Product pages
3. **Marketplace Service**: Handles listings, transactions, and messaging
4. **Community Service**: Manages nodes, community interactions, and governance
5. **Visualization Service**: Processes data for 3D globe visualization
6. **Subscription Service**: Handles business subscriptions and payments
7. **Search Service**: Provides platform-wide search capabilities
8. **Content Service**: Manages educational resources and content

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Token Distribution Mechanism**: The PRD mentions a token-based governance system but doesn't specify how tokens are initially distributed or earned. A fair distribution mechanism would need to be defined.

2. **Quality Verification**: For circular economy products, quality verification is crucial. The platform may need an additional subsystem for quality assurance, possibly involving third-party certification.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Different regions have different regulations for waste management and processing. The platform should consider how to handle this complexity.

4. **Agent-Based Revenue Streams**: The PRD mentions future revenue streams in the form of agents. Further clarification on what these agents would do and how they would generate revenue would help in planning the architecture to accommodate this future expansion.

5. **Data Migration**: For value chains with existing data sources, a strategy for importing and standardizing this data would be needed.

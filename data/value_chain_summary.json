These chains represent tangible opportunities for valorizing common waste streams\u2014including textiles, plastics, e-waste, biomass, and construction debris\u2014into higher-value products through chemical transformation.Each entry details the required inputs, outputs, processes, technology, and skills. The provided economic estimates for **Startup Cost** and **Potential Monthly Revenue** are illustrative and designed to indicate the potential scale of operation (e.g., pilot, small-to-medium enterprise, industrial). These figures are derived from high-level data points in the reference material (e.g., cost per ton of output, capital estimates for large plants) and should be validated with detailed, market-specific business cases. Profitability in these ventures is often heavily influenced by the acquisition cost of waste feedstock, process efficiency, and local market prices for output products.The following tables are categorized by primary input material for ease of navigation and strategic planning.***### **Waste Valorization Value Chains**#### **1.

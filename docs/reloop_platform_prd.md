## Executive Summary

Genesis: ReLoop is a comprehensive circular economy platform designed to transform waste into valuable products through an interconnected network of value chains. The platform bridges the gap between waste providers, process operators, and product buyers, creating a sustainable ecosystem for circular economy initiatives.

The platform will consist of three key interconnected components for each of 100+ circular economy value chains: Feedstock Pages (waste source inputs), ChemHub Pages (process chains, transformation methods), and LoopCrafted Product Pages (finished upcycled products). ReLoop will feature a marketplace where users can trade materials and products, with a subscription-based business model that's affordable for startups. The platform incorporates decentralized governance mechanisms to ensure community-driven decision-making and standard setting.

This PRD outlines the market analysis, user personas, feature specifications, UI/UX requirements, content strategy, technical requirements, and implementation roadmap for the Genesis: ReLoop platform.
